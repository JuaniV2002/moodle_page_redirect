# moodle_page_redirect
This Moodle plugin will redirect a user to a given page of a course. Since it uses your session data, you will be shown that page the first time you jump inside that course in that session. I use it to show the user a brief description of the course.

It includes a settings page under the local section so that the name of the page can be changed.
